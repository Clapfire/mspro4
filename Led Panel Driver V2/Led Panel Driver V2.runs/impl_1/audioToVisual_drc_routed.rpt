CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1840 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_driver/state_counter_1/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_driver/state_counter_1/p_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell led_driver/state_counter_1/p_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_driver/state_counter_1/lat_OBUF is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_driver/state_counter_1/lat_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell led_driver/state_counter_1/lat_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT led_driver/state_counter_1/lat_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 5 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    led_driver/latch_counter_1/count_reg[2] {FDPE}
    led_driver/latch_counter_1/count_reg[0] {FDPE}
    led_driver/latch_counter_1/count_reg[4] {FDPE}
    led_driver/latch_counter_1/count_reg[1] {FDPE}
    led_driver/latch_counter_1/count_reg[3] {FDPE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT led_driver/state_counter_1/p_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 29 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    led_driver/compare_2/output_reg {FDRE}
    led_driver/red1/count_2_reg[0] {FDRE}
    led_driver/red1/count_2_reg[2] {FDRE}

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 led_driver/mem_R/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram has an input control pin led_driver/mem_R/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram/ADDRARDADDR[9] (net: led_driver/mem_R/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/addrb[4]) which is driven by a register (led_driver/pos_counter_1/count_reg[4]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
