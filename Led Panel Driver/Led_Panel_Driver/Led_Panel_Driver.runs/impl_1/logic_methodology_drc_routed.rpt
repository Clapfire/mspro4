2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell c3/p_clk_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) c1/p_clk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
